    "This notebook covers how to combine agents and vector stores. The use case for this is that you've ingested your data into a vector store and want to interact with it in an agentic manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended method for doing so is to create a `RetrievalQA` and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

However, many users have successfully switched from Flake8 to Ruff. Ruff also has the ability to automatically fix its own lint violations, while Flake8 does not. Ruff is also compatible with Black, isort, yesqa, eradicate, and most of the rules implemented in pyupgrade, while Flake8 is not. Ruff can also be used as a formatter, while Flake8 cannot. Ruff supports Python 3.7 onwards, while Flake8 supports Python 2. Ruff is also available on PyPI, while Flake8 is not.'"
